### Sprint 2 - DB connectivity 

- In this Sprint, we have created the need tables
			-"user_login" to store user's email, password and Name;
			-"user_data" to store user's email with user's category preference 
- Established DB connectivity for User Sign Up and Log In
- The flow of the process is the user can select Sign Up or Login from the Home page, and if they have Sign Up successfully , they can proceed for Log In , their details will be displayed on the next page of successfull Login. (used as result for this sprint).
- First time users. Run sqlite_db_setup.py first, then app.py.
